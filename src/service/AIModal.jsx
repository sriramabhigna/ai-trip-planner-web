You'll need to replace these with actual image URLs.  You can find suitable images on websites like Unsplash, Pexels, or by doing a Google Image search (be mindful of copyright).\n*   **Prices:** Prices are estimates and can vary significantly depending on the time of year, day of the week, and how far in advance you book.  Always check current prices before your trip.\n*   **Transportation:** This itinerary assumes a mix of walking, public transportation (the Deuce bus is a good option for the Strip), and ride-sharing/taxis when necessary.\n*   **Discounts:** Look for discounts on attractions and shows on websites like Groupon, Vegas.com, and the attraction's own website.  Also, many hotels offer coupon books upon check-in.\n*   **Flexibility:** This is just a suggestion. Feel free to customize it based on your interests and preferences.\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night. Stick to well-lit and populated areas.\n*   **Hydration:**  Las Vegas is in the desert.  Drink plenty of water.\n*   **Food:** Look for affordable food options like fast food, food courts, and buffets (but be mindful of buffet prices, as they can vary).\n\nThis JSON provides a solid starting point for planning your budget-friendly Vegas trip!
